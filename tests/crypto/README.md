# Test Crypto

Do not use the keys in this folder for production use.

This folder provides cryptographic keys for testing.

There are two keypairs provided here. An EC keypair and an RSA keypair.

The private keys are not encrypted since they are used for testing.
In production use cases, private keys should always be encrypted.
