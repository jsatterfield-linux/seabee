## Log Level Error

Indicates something unexpected, a problem or bug in the code

## Log Level Warn

Most commonly used when SeaBee blocks an action, correlates with security level 'blocked' in policy

## Log Level Info

Prints useful, but not security-related information to the user.
Also correlates with security level 'audit' in policy.

## Log Level Debug

Primarily identifies control flow to help debug where an error happens

## Log Level Trace

Similar to debug, but even more fine-grained
